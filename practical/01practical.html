    <h2>DOCTYPE Declaration (&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;):</h2>
    <p>
      This declaration defines the type of document being used. In this case,
      we're using the HTML5 doctype. It helps the browser understand which
      version of HTML is being used in the document. Using the correct doctype
      ensures that the browser renders the webpage in standards-compliant mode,
      preventing compatibility issues and ensuring consistent rendering across
      different browsers.

    <h2>Meta Tags:</h2>
    <h3>1. &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</h3>
    <p>
      This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is
      a character encoding that supports a wide range of characters from
      different languages. It ensures that the text on the webpage is displayed
      correctly, regardless of the language used.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. &lt;meta name="description" content="Webpage displaying my name&gt;
    </h3>
    <p>
      This meta tag provides a brief description of the webpage's content.
      Search engines often use this description in search results to give users
      a preview of the page's content. It's important for search engine
      optimization (SEO) and for helping users understand the purpose of the
      webpage.
    </p>
    <h3>3. &lt;meta name="keywords" content="name, example, web page"&gt;</h3>
    <p>
      Although not as crucial for SEO as it once was, this meta tag used to
      provide a list of keywords related to the content of the webpage. Search
      engines would use these keywords to help index and categorize the webpage.
      However, modern search engines primarily focus on the actual content of
      the page rather than relying heavily on this meta tag.
    </p>
    <h3>4. &lt;meta name="author" content="ChatGPT"&gt;</h3>
    <p>
      This meta tag indicates the author of the webpage's content. It can be
      useful for attributing content to its creator, and it might also provide a
      way for users to contact the author if needed.
